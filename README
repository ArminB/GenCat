GenCat is supposed to be a utility to manage and organize 
collections of files of a given type, e.g. documents or mp3.
It collects information from file names, properties, 
tags, meta information ... whatever is associated with the files
and builds up a searchable database or a structured directory listing, 
like an index html file.
It shall be easily extendable for new file types, by adding classes for each file type
that implements a given interface.
A sorted list of regular expressions is used to fill the output fields.
